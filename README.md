 ## Personal Information
 - Male, Born in 1994
 - Phd stduent, University Science and Technology of China
 - State Key Laboratory of Fire Science
## Research Expeirence
-  Fire detection, radiative effects of fire emitted particles on the environment
     -  Study on the distinguishing method between fire particles and different interference sources using multi-angle scattering matrix
     -  The effects of morphology and mixed state on the radiative characteristics of black carbon were studied using the superimposed T matrix and DDA methods.
     -  Parameterization of radiative properties of black carbon using statistical learning methods such as support vector machine (SVM).
     -  Mie, superimposed T-matrix, DDA and other methods were used to analyze the effects of brown carbon on black carbon particle absorption enhancement, and the lens effect was redefined clearly through theoretical analysis. The concept of sunglasses effect was proposed, and the mathematical definition was given.
